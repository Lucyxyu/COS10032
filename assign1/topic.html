            The history of JavaScript is fascinating and to understand it we need to rewind the clock back almost 40
            years.

                    were

        <p>JavaScript, often referred to as JS for short is a <em>scripting or programming language used primarily in
                the development
                of Websites and Webpages</em>. Javascript is supported by many frameworks and is extremely versatile
            whether being used for frontend, backend, web applications and even apps.</p>
        <p>
            Unlike HTML which is the structural backbone of web development, CSS which is predominantly styling and
            layout or design, JavaScript creates <em>dynamically updating and interactive websites</em> (Fig 2). These
            include
            multimedia aspects like moving images, video, interactive buttons and sounds. A website without Javascript
            will quite a dull one indeed!
        </p>
        <p>You can look at it like any other
            high-level (Human readable) machine language, for example, C++.

            It is Layer 3 Of the layer cake of standard web technologies, The first of which being HTML and the second
            CSS.
        </p>
    </section>

    <aside id="Java">
        JavaScript is often confused with Java however they are different! Java is a high level object oriented
        programming language used for multiple complex and sophisticated applications such as Android apps, financial
        software and chatbots.
        JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used to enhance the interactivity of websites and browser games, as
        well as connect web applications to servers.

    <section id="current">
        <h3>Current state of Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            The power and versatility of JavaScript in both front and backend development means it is the most popular
            programming language in the world (Trienpont International). Statistics obtained from various sources show:
        </p>
        <ul id="JS-stats">
            <li> 67.8% Of developers were using it in 2019.</li>
            <li> It is used to build 95.2% (1.52 Billion) Websites today.</li>
            <li> According to w3techs, JavaScript is used as client-side programming language by 98.9% of all the
                websites.</li>
            <li> For over 7 years in a row, JS has been ranked the most commonly used programming language.</li>
            <li>According to GitHub's 2018 Octoverse Report; There are more JavaScript code repositories than any other
                language (with the number steadily rising)</li>
            <li> Some of the biggest sites we know such as YouTube & Facebook utilise Javascript.</li>
            <li>Virtually all web browsers support JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Since NetScape handed JavaScript over to the ECMA in 1996, JavaScript has been overseen and developed by
            committee TC39. The JavaScript specification manual is now developed on GitHub with the help of the
            community. Users can contribute by submitting requests and reporting issues. These are then reviewed by the
            committee and decisions are made.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="future">
        <h3>Future trends</h3>
        <p>
            Since it's inception in 1995 where it revolutionised the web browsing experience, JS has solidified its
            status as a crucial component of the web browser and other applications. 
        </p>
        <p>The many updates to JS means that standalone JavaScript is rarely used these days - its power comes from
            combining it with multiple frameworks and technologies to run complex applications. Popular
            frameworks include react.js, angular.js and node.js.
            Due to it's widespread usage, deeprooted connection to web browsers, expansive range of frameworks and open
            source community, JS remains versatile and adaptable to changing trends and requirements. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of JS looks promising and the language will not die out anytime soon.
            Now, even with the rise in AI, JavaScript still remains highly relevant as users use the web to communicate
            with these interfaces - and as the web is dominated by JavaScript it will continue to be used.

        <h3>Related technologies</h3>
        <p>
            In website building, the three core development languages are HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is almost
            impossible to find a website that does not utilise all three of these technologies - they are all inexorably
            linked.

            The table below compares some key features between the three.
